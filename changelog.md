# 4swbbevb-power-voltage-mode-control, release v1.0.0

### Release Highlights
This is the initial release demonstrating the basic control loop implementation of a simple digital voltage mode control loop regulating the output voltage of a 4-switch buck boost converter.
This example is part #1 of a series of code examples for the 4-Switch Buck-Boost Converter.

### Features Added\Updated

* User-button short pressed: power controller is being switched on/off
* User-button pressed long (>1s): power controller switches between open loop and closed voltage mode loop
* Green LED on: PWM enabled (power stage is running)
* Green LED off:  PWM disabled (power stage is not running)
* Red LED off: closed loop
* Red LED slow blinking: open loop
* Red LED on: error
* An external potentiometer can be used to adjust the reference
* The Power Board Visualizer GUI connected to the serial interface can be used to visualize and adjust the behaviour
