  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
 
    This source file contains the application specific tasks that are called regularly by the os_scheduler
        two different timings priorities are available:
          1. 1ms Tasks called from the os_scheduler interrupt
              the jitter that you will have in the 1ms realtime tasks called by the interrupt depends
              on other interrupts that have a higher interrupt priority
          2. 1ms, 10ms, 100ms, 1s Tasks called from the main loop
              these tasks are for soft realtime and not for hard realtime
              so in average they are called with the required timing but the jitter can be very huge,
              depending on the calls before.
              use this for your non-timing critical application state machines

 @note    you might consider to implement a watchdog and put the watchdog triggering into some Task

//                          put your application specific code in the following functions:
//                              choose wisely between real-time and non-realtime!
//
//  Interrupt Realtime Functions:
//  Tasks_Realtime_1ms  :   is called by the interrupt every ms - for time critical low jitter stuff
//
//
//  Mainloop Non-Realtime Functions:
//  Tasks_1ms           :   function is called by the main loop in average every 1ms
//  Tasks_10ms          :   function is called by the main loop in average every 10ms
//  Tasks_100ms         :   function is called by the main loop in average every 100ms
//  Tasks_1s            :   function is called by the main loop in average every second
//
//  @note there could be some jitter here because it is not called directly by a timer interrupt
//        the timing in average is exact (keep in mind: in average), the jitter depends on the
//        called functions before
