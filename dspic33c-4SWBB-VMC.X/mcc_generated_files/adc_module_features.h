  @File Name
    adc_module_features.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated module feature header file for ADC driver 
    using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs.
    This file provides module feature list available on the selected device. 
    The macros defined in this file provides the flexibility to easily migrate the user
    application to other device which might have varied feature list.
         
    The content in this file is strictly "read only" and should not be altered.

  @Description
    This header file provides module feature list for ADC driver.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.167.0
        Device            :  dsPIC33CK256MP506      
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.50
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v5.35
