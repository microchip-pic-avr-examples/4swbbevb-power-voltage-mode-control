  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CLC1 driver using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CLC1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.167.0
        Device            :  dsPIC33CK256MP506
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.50
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v5.35
